# Snippets and Templates

This is meant to provide some resources for my blog post on [Text Expansion and Snippets][postlink]

## Templates for Notes

### Concert Plan
I use this to set up each concert as its own note in Obsidian. I keep this particular template in Alfred, though I should probably move it over to TextExpander to expedite filling out the fields. Other than reminding myself what I want to link to/from each concert note, this template is largely there to help me remember the organization structure I want in a note; these can get pretty sprawling, and having that consistency has helped me. 

### Percussion Assignments
I personally assign each percussionist in each of my bands a part on each piece based on a whole host of factors. I have this template set up so that it looks the way I want every single time – I use the [Amelia style in Marked](https://marked2app.com/styles/preview#Amelia ), which I've just settled on being the consistent 'Percussion Assignment sheet appearance' in my band room, so that my older students don't even have to get close to where I post it to notice that a new one is up. I like a lot of Marked styles, this is just the one I happened to settle on for this purpose. 

This is the only template in here that's really more about its appearance when it's *done* than it is about setting up my organization right away.

These files live in Obsidian now so they can be linked to. Because it's primarily about its printed appearance, I don't have these files link back to their respective concerts – I just rely on the backlinks in Obsidian to do that for now.

### Church Instrumental Music Plan

We arrange special instrumentalists 4~5 times a year at my church with a combination of youth and adults. After the service is planned, I set up this note to keep track of what music we're doing for it (we normally just stick to the opening hymn, office hymn, and closing hymn) and to help with the short project of arranging these hymns for the appropriate instrument transpositions. I also use this to help me keep track of what we've discussed in the email thread (I am grateful someone else normally takes care of initiating contact with everyone else and beginning the discussion of a rehearsal, so I only need to grab the link to that from Airmail). 

**Example of this note in the examples folder: `2023-10-29 Reformation Brass.md`**

This one lives in TextExpander and winds up as an Obsidian note for my reference. Anything in the {curly brackets} is a 'Single Line Field' fill-in in TextExpander.
