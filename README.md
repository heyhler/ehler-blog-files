# ehler-blog-files

The "meat" of this repository is in `./Notation Files/Dorico Example Projects/`

All these files are referenced and explained in better detail on individual posts on <mrehler.com>. I'm not very experienced with git, so forgive any conventions I'm breaking if you're more experienced.

I will try to have individual README.md files within subfolders to help explain and provide context.

If you're unfamiliar with git, click on the folders above to go through the different projectsâ€¦ If you prefer, you can download the whole 'repository' by cliking the "Code" button on the top-right and selecting "Download Zip." Then, just unzip the whole thing and go through it comfortably on your own computer. If you're comfortable with git, do whatever you want.
