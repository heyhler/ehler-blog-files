In this file are various automations (however basic) I've made that I can easily share

These Alfred workflows aren't so useful that I'd share them on the [Alfred Gallery](https://alfred.app), because if they were, I'd fork them into their own repo.

## Alfred Workflows

### ABFR File Action

Very simple, just makes a [file action][alfredfileaction] for [A Better Finder Rename](http://www.publicspace.net/ABetterFinderRename/index.html).

### Marked Paste Preview

Quick way to get whatever's on your clipboard to preview in [Marked](https://marked2app.com). About as [simple](https://marked2app.com/help/URL_Handler.html#paste) as it gets.

### Rogue Amoeba Apps Forgotten

Both the most complicated workflow and also, arguably, the dumbest or least useful.

Doesn't include Airfoil. I use Airfoil, though.
