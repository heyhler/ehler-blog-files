In this file are various automations (however basic) I've made that I can easily share

These Alfred workflows aren't so useful that I'd share them on the [Alfred Gallery](https://alfred.app), because if they were, I'd fork them into their own repo in hopes of getting them on there.

## Alfred Workflows



### ABFR File Action

Very simple, just makes a [file action][alfredfileaction] for [A Better Finder Rename](http://www.publicspace.net/ABetterFinderRename/index.html).

### Marked Paste Preview

Quick way to get whatever's on your clipboard to preview in [Marked](https://marked2app.com). About as [simple](https://marked2app.com/help/URL_Handler.html#paste) as it gets, just a URL scheme.

### Rogue Amoeba Apps Forgotten

Both the most complicated workflow and also, arguably, the dumbest or least useful.

Doesn't include Airfoil. I use Airfoil, though.

### Add to Play/MusicBox

So this one actually is a [separate repo](https://github.com/mrehler/alfred-play-musicbox-workflow). Adds items to [Play](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1596506190) and [MusicBox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1614730313) from Alfred.

## Recommended Alfred Workflows

Beyond the ones I've made, these are the Alfred workflows I use (much more useful than what I've made!):

- [1Password](https://alfred.app/workflows/alfredapp/1password) - 
    + Actually a substitute for the old, [built-in feature](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/1password/)
- Add Reminders
- [Advanced Google and Apple Maps Search](https://github.com/stuartcryan/advanced-google-maps-alfred-workflow)
    + Great for quickly getting travel time for school events
- [Conductor](https://www.thoughtasylum.com/2022/04/22/an-update-to-the-conductor-workflow/)
    + I aspire to get more use out of Keyboard Maestro than I do, but triggering workflows with Alfred is a great boon!
- [Convert](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-convert)
- [Craft Docs](https://github.com/kudrykv/alfred-craftdocs-searchindex) - Mostly for searching
- OmniFocus
    + "New OmniFocus Inbox Task"
    + "[Search OmniFocus](https://github.com/rhydlewis/alfred-search-omnifocus)"
    + {>> The combination is incredibly useful â€“ ELABORATE <<}
