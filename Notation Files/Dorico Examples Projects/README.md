# Dorico Examples

This folder (should be) the meat of what's on here.

In addition to actual .dorico files, there's PDFs of just about everything in here, at least for the instruments I have/had in my bands at the time I originally made the proejct. But the Dorico file is in here for you to fill in any yourself!

I make no guarantees of compatibility with these Dorico files. If you're using an old version of Dorico, assume they'll break at any time, because I'm liable to resave them under a new version. I have no idea how Dorico handles compatbility going backwards, only going forwards.

## Rhythm Assessments

[Original Article][rhythmassessmentarticle]

I've got sample projects from a few different semesters organized as their own folders (with PDFs for each ensemble I work with and the 'master page' that I do make for myself) and their accompanying Dorico projects. In the top folder, I have a template file, a 'blank' file (the easiest thing to work with before Dorico 4.0 added proper template support) and a file that just bunches every rhythm assessment to date into flows. I'll write an article some day about exporting individual flows from this project to make your own sets of rhythm assessments (if you were inclined to lift from mine). 

Names aren't completely consistent. Still haven't settled on a scheme I love.

## Scale Sheets

- Perhaps missing instruments
- Prefer to keep the flat/sharp switch to happen between G♭ and B for everyone – made an exception starting this year for saxophones (to switch between A♭ and C♯). 
    + The double-octave scales reflect that older switch. Will be updated some time before the spring semester of 2024. 
    + The old versions of these are in the "./(Alternate Sax Sheets)" folder.
- Each of the PDFs is two pages – one with the appropriate key signature listed, and one page with no key signatures, but with every accidental listed.
    + The second page is labelled keyless. *Obviously* thhey have a key, but I can't come up with a better shorthand name for them. If you have a suggestion for that, legitimately let me know.
    + I have each page as their own PDF file. I'm not planning on posting them here, but if others would find it valuable (instead of just deleting one of the two pages in a PDF app or sending only one of the two pages to the printer), I can.

### Major Scales

- I'm considering changing the flute sheet to only show the top octave for G and G♭ Major Scales.
    + I'm also considering only doing that for the G scale
    + I would put this current sheet in the alternate folder if I were to do that
