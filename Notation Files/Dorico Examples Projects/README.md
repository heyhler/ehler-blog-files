# Dorico Examples

This folder (should be) the meat of what's on here.

In addition to actual .dorico files, there's PDFs of just about everything in here.

## Rhythm Assessments

[Original Article][rhythmassessmentarticle]

I've got sample projects from a few different semesters organized as their own folders (with PDFs for each ensemble I work with and the 'master page' that I do make for myself) and their accompanying Dorico projects. In the top folder, I have a template file, a 'blank' file (the easiest thing to work with before Dorico 4.0 added proper template support) and a file that just bunches every rhythm assessment to date into flows. I'll write an article some day about exporting individual flows from this project to make your own sets of rhythm assessments (if you were inclined to lift from mine). 

Names aren't completely consistent. Still haven't settled on a scheme I love.

## Scale Sheets
