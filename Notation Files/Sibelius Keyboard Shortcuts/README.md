# Sibelius Keyboard Shortcuts

For what it's worth, this was last used with a 2018 version of Sibelius, so it might have issues with older *or* newer versions.

This folder has the shortcuts file itself. Instructions on how to install them (and a more full description of their use) is on [my blog post about them][shortcutspost].

Further along in that article is a file for a speculative fix having to do with "Word Menus," which is also here.

There's also a video I made explaining how to install my shortcuts.

Last, I did some demo videos ([1][demo1], [2][demo2]) to show these shortcuts in action. These videos showed me transcribing Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 13 Op. 27 No. 1. The original scores I was working off of can be found on [IMSLP][imslplink]. 
 
Again, these are no longer maintained, as I've [moved][doricobro] to Dorico for all of my notation software needs. I still believe these are a useful set of shortcuts that others can find very useful.
